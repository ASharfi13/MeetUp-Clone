The talking gumball machine, Pops, floats around the park, blissfully unaware of the chaos that ensues daily.

Our main character, Mac, is a kid with a knack for imagining friends, and his imaginary buddy Bloo is the embodiment of mischief and sass â€“ think Bugs Bunny with fur. Madame Foster, the caretaker, is a delightful mix of eccentricity and granny wisdom, and her imaginary friend, Mr. Herriman, is a rabbit who takes bureaucracy way too seriously, wearing a suit that screams, I mean business in Candy Land! The diverse bunch of imaginary friends populating the home could give the United Nations a run for its money, with quirky personalities that range from the melodramatic Wilt to the eccentric Eduardo. In this animated utopia, where forgotten friends find a home, chaos is the norm, and logic is left at the door faster than you can say Imagination at its finest!",

Their mom, simply known as Mom, is the epitome of parental obliviousness, and their dad, Dad, is a classic example of the dad-joke aficionado. Dexter's nemesis and neighbor, Mandark, with his wild hair and maniacal laughter, is the yin to Dexter's yang, creating a rivalry that puts even the best sibling squabbles to shame.
